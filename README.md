# SpeedyBharat: Transforming Intercity Logistics

## Who We Are
SpeedyBharat is a tech-enabled logistics startup revolutionizing intercity parcel delivery by leveraging India’s vast bus network. Our mission is to bridge the gap in logistics efficiency, offering businesses and consumers a cost-effective, real-time tracked, and fast shipping solution. We are doing this under the guidance of **NDIIT College, New Delhi**.

## Our Team
**SpeedyBharat** was started by **Hardik Kathuria** and **Abhishek Ojha**, both pursuing PGDM at NDIIT College, New Delhi.

- **Hardik Kathuria** brings expertise in digital marketing, logistics management, and strategic planning. His experience in handling large-scale logistics projects and working with NGOs gives him a deep understanding of operational efficiency and customer needs.
- **Abhishek Ojha** is a dynamic entrepreneur and business strategist specializing in market research, business development, and operations management. His keen analytical skills and vision for scalable logistics solutions drive SpeedyBharat’s mission.

## What We Are Doing
We are creating a structured logistics platform that integrates with intercity bus operators to facilitate 24-hour parcel delivery across distances of 300-350 km. By utilizing the unused cargo space in buses, we are building an efficient, scalable, and technology-driven logistics solution that addresses inefficiencies of traditional courier services.

## The Problem We Are Addressing

### 1. Limited Intercity Parcel Transport via Buses
- Most private bus operators focus solely on passenger transport.
- Unutilized cargo space in buses remains untapped.

### 2. High Logistics Costs for Small Businesses
- Instagram merchants avoid orders due to high shipping costs.
- Reverse logistics and COD unavailability hinder order fulfillment.

### 3. Unstructured Small Transporter Market
- Jaipur has ~2000 registered transporters.
- Lack of marketing support and tech integration limits growth.

### 4. Lack of Last-Mile Delivery
- No structured system for doorstep delivery.
- 400-500 C2C parcels move daily in NCR without organized delivery.

### 5. Manual Procurement by Retailers
- Retailers travel to Delhi for goods, adding time and costs.
- No structured procurement/delivery solution.

## How We Will Solve This

### Tech-Enabled Aggregator Platform
- Connects bus operators, senders, and last-mile agents.
- AI-based route optimization.

### Real-Time GPS Tracking
- Uses pre-installed GPS on buses.
- Customers get live tracking and accurate ETAs.

### Strategic Partnerships
- Monetizes unused cargo space.
- Expanding to private/state-run bus operators.

### Seamless Merchant Integration
- Affordable intercity parcel shipping with COD.
- Support for return logistics.

### Last-Mile Delivery Network
- Onboard agents for doorstep delivery.
- Partner with existing logistics services.
